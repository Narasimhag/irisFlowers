My attempt at classification - 100 days of ML code

In this project, I attempt to get the data from this (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data) dataset,
visualize it using matplotlib library and apply some Machine Learning algorithms
to it, to classify the data.

Day #0: Get the data and visualize it.
